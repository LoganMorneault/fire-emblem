Hello! I'd love to be using JUnit for these tests, but I decided early on that I'd like to use VSCode to make this and I haven't been able to properly set it up.

I've successfully used JUnit in both Eclipse and IntelliJ, but for whatever reason it's substantially harder to set up in VSC and the hour I spent trying to work it out was pretty much wasted. Instead, I'll be creating tests for each class in dedicated test classes using Java's built-in assert. The class TestMain will be used as a hub to run them all.
