The design philosophy for these characters is inspired very heavily by Fire Emblem and Pokemon. In these games, damage takes one of two forms: physical and energy (or magic). Each damage type is resisted by a matching defensive stat. 

In Fire Emblem, turn order is not fixed, so speedier characters have the potential to attack twice. These characters also tend to be weaker, which balances this somewhat. In Pokemon, turn order is fixed and is determined by speed. I'd like to combine these somehow, as I like the concept of a fixed turn order, but I'd also like to consider attack doubling as an option.

In Fire Emblem, the damage type is determined by the weapon used; in Pokemon, it's the move you use. In both games, there is a differetn stat used for damage of either typ, but I'm simplifying it for now and locking damage type to weapons

I want to preserve the grid-based aspect of games like Fire Emblem or even D&D, so being able to move around the battlefield is a requirement. Move speed is a good way to add variety to different Heroes.
